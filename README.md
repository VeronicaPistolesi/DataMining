## Bots in Twitter
The project consists of a data analysis based on data mining tools and performed using Python. The given original dataset consists of 2 .csv files, tweets.csv and users.csv, from which we
extracted the data for the project. The work is broken down in four phases: 
1. Task 1 which includes the two sub-tasks of data understanding and data preparation 
2. Task 2 which is the clustering of our processed data 
3. Task 3 comprising a predictive analysis on the data through classification models 
4. Task 4 in which time series were developed and analysed based off the data by days.
